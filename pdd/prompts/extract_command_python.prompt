% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to create a PDD CLI command for managing LLM-powered extractions.

% Role & Scope
The `extract` command provides a CLI interface for the `llm_extractor` module, allowing users to refresh, list, and preview semantic extractions.

% Requirements
1. Implement `extract` command in `pdd/commands/extract.py` using `click`.
2. Support subcommands:
   - `refresh [PROMPT_FILE]`: Re-runs all `<extract>` tags found in the specified prompt file(s).
   - `list`: Lists all cached extractions in `.pdd/extracts/` with metadata (source, query, size).
   - `status`: Checks for staleness of all cached extractions relative to their source files.
   - `preview PATH --query QUERY`: Performs a one-off extraction and displays it to stdout without caching.
3. Integrate with `LLMExtractor` for extraction logic.
4. Use `rich` for beautiful table outputs and status messages.
5. Register the command in `pdd/commands/__init__.py` (Note: this is a manual integration point, but the module should be designed for it).
6. Support `--force` to skip confirmation prompts where applicable.

% Dependencies
<llm_extractor_interface>
# Expected interface for pdd.llm_extractor (yet to be generated)
class LLMExtractor:
    def refresh_extractions(self, prompt_path: str = None) -> list[dict]:
        """Refreshes extractions. Returns list of updated extraction metadata."""
        pass

    def list_extractions(self) -> list[dict]:
        """Returns list of all cached extractions with metadata."""
        pass

    def check_status(self) -> list[dict]:
        """Checks staleness. Returns list of extraction status dicts."""
        pass

    def preview_extraction(self, path: str, query: str) -> str:
        """Performs one-off extraction without caching."""
        pass
</llm_extractor_interface>

% Deliverables
- Code: `pdd/commands/extract.py`
